-Waveform-
	Sequence: Rabi, CP/CPMG, Pulse train, Generic sequence
	Sample rate: xxx samples per second
	Number of points: number of samples in one output?
	First pulse delays[s]: the time interval between the center of the pulse and the start of the output
	Trim waveform to sequence: display(?) the waveform from the first non-zero point to the last non-zero point
	Number of outputs: maximum is Four. For each output, there are three channels, Trace-I, Trace-Q, Trace-Gate, that can be sent to the AWG.

-Sequence-
	# of pulses: number of pulses. The pulse can be a square pulse, a ramp pulse or a Gaussian pulse. The pulses can be in the same output or in different outputs.

-Pulse settings-
	Pulse type: Square, Ramp, Gaussian
	Truncation range: only applies to Gaussian pulses. Truncate the pulse. The duration of the Gaussian pulse is TruncRange * Width + Plateau. See code: dTotTime = truncRange*dWidth + dPlateau
	Edge-to-edge pulses: make pulses more isolated from the other ones. dPulseT = pulseEdgeWidth * width + plateau
